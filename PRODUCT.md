# Product Requirements

## 1. Introduction

### Vision
An intelligent knowledge learning platform that helps users master any subject matter through scientifically-optimized spaced repetition. The system adapts to each learner's performance, presenting content at optimal intervals to maximize retention and minimize study time.

### Core Goals
- **Effective Learning**: Utilize SM-2 algorithm for optimal memory retention.
- **Personalized Experience**: Adapt review schedules to individual performance.
- **Efficient Management**: Enable batch import/export and quality control for content managers.
- **Scalability**: Handle large volumes of knowledge items and users.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Learning Model (Spaced Repetition)
The system is built on the **SM-2 algorithm**, which determines the optimal time to review a card based on:
- **Quality Rating**: User's self-assessed performance (0-5).
- **Repetitions**: Number of successful consecutive reviews.
- **Ease Factor**: A multiplier indicating how easy the item is for the user.

**Learning States**:
- **New**: Never reviewed.
- **Learning**: In progress (reviewed 1-2 times successfully).
- **Review**: Established (reviewed 3+ times successfully).

### 2.2 Content Structure
- **Knowledge Items**: The fundamental units of learning (vocabulary, facts, concepts).
    - Unique immutable code (`ST-XXXXXXX` or `CS-XXXXXXX`).
    - Name, Description, and Metadata (JSONB).
    - Relationships to other items.
- **Card Types**: Different ways to present knowledge (e.g., Term → Definition, Fill-in-the-blank).
- **Templates**: Visual layout definitions for card types (Front/Back content).
- **Account Cards**: A user-specific instance of a (Knowledge Item + Card Type) pair, tracking their personal progress.

## 3. User Roles & Workflows

### 3.1 Learners (Clients)
End-users focused on mastering content.

**Key Workflows**:
1.  **Onboarding**: 
    - Sign up -> System automatically initializes `Account Cards` for all available knowledge.
2.  **Daily Review**:
    - View cards due for review (`next_review_date <= today`).
    - Reveal answer and rate quality (0-5).
    - System reschedules the card.
3.  **Progress Tracking**:
    - View dashboard with statistics (Total, New, Learning, Due Today).

### 3.2 Content Managers (Operators)
Internal users managing the knowledge base.

**Key Workflows**:
1.  **Batch Import/Export**:
    - Export existing knowledge to CSV.
    - Edit/Add rows in CSV.
    - Upload CSV -> System validates -> System compares changes.
2.  **Approval Workflow**:
    - Review validation results (New, Updated, Deleted items).
    - Approve changes -> System applies updates and generates codes for new items.
3.  **Single Item Management**:
    - Create/Edit individual items via Operator Dashboard (Drawer UI).

## 4. Business Rules

### 4.1 SM-2 Algorithm Rules
- **Passed (Quality ≥ 3)**: Interval increases based on Ease Factor.
- **Failed (Quality < 3)**: Interval resets to 1 day; Ease Factor decreases.
- **First Review**: Interval = 1 day.
- **Second Review**: Interval = 6 days.

### 4.2 Content Management Rules
- **Immutable Codes**: Once generated, a knowledge code (`ST-0000001`) never changes.
- **Code Generation**:
    - `ST-`: Standard items (default).
    - `CS-`: Case Study/Custom items.
- **Validation**: Imports must pass schema validation before approval.

### 4.3 User Account Rules
- **Initialization**: Users get access to ALL current knowledge items upon signup.
- **Isolation**: One user's progress does not affect another's.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Review sessions must load quickly (<200ms).
- **Reliability**: Import workflows must be atomic and robust (using temporal patterns).
- **Security**: Role-based access control (Learner vs. Operator).
